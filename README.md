# Go Fake GraphQL API

Simple API returning the same data as [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) built using go and the [`chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/) and [`graphql-go`](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) libraries.

Only a subset of the original relations is currently implemented.
